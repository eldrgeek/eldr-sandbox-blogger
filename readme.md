## Test program for google APIs to spreadsheet and blogger

The program runs on CodeSandbox (for now) in a wired-in container

To set up keys go go [Cloud console](https://console.cloud.google.com) and then search for Credentials.

On the credential page you may need to authorize the domain, the requesting URL and the return URL

If it's a new app (as opposed to a new site serving an existing one) you mmay
need to generate a client_id and a client_secret.

It contains these keys set up in cloud console
CLIENT_ID
CLIENT_SECRET

And these, obtained from the URL of the sheet and the blog
SHEET_KEY
BLOG_KEY
